# Turbulent Properties
This work is a project proposed on the Introduction to Turbulence Course at UnB by Professor Jos√© Luiz Fontoura.
The results are presented in the '.pdf' file.

## Abstract
The project involves studying turbulent flows over a rugged body, in this case, a cube, using the statistical treatment of hot-wire anemometry measurements inside a wind tunnel. The properties are analysed using the Reynolds decomposition, which may be summarized as:

1. Spatial, Temporal, and Statistical Averages
2. Velocity Fluctuations
3. Turbulent Kinetic Energy by unit mass
4. Turbulent Intensity
5. Higher Order Moments:
   1. Standard Deviation
   2. Skewness
   3. Kurtosis
   4. Covariance
   5. Correlation Coefficient
  
The calculation of all properties was implemented manually with numpy and matplotlib and stored in Dataclassed for better organization and encapsulation. The results were presented to the professor and are all correct.
